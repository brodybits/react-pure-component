#React es6, es7 pure component without pure render mixin

#[React Mixins are on their way out](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#mixins)
> Unfortunately, we will not launch any mixin support for ES6 classes in React. That would defeat the purpose of only using idiomatic JavaScript concepts.
> There is no standard and universal way to define mixins in JavaScript. In fact, several features to support mixins were dropped from ES6 today. There are a lot of libraries with different semantics. We think that there should be one way of defining mixins that you can use for any JavaScript class. React just making another doesnâ€™t help that effort.

###es7
```js
import {Component} from 'react';
import PureComponent from 'react-pure-component';

@PureComponent
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div> Hello Pure World </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

###es6
```js
import {Component} from 'react';
import PureComponent from 'react-pure-component';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div> Hello Pure World </div>
    );
  }
}

export default PureComponent(App);
```

###es5
```js
const React = require('react');
const PureComponent = require('react-pure-component');

const App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div> Hello Pure World </div>
    );
  }
})

module.exports = PureComponent(App);
```
